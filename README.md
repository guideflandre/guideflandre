## Hi there 👋

I am Guillaume Deflandre, a PhD student at the UCLouvain, based at the de Duve institute in Brussels.
I am part of Laurent Gatto's CBIO lab and my focus lies on optimisation of peptidoform identifications
in single-cell proteomics. To do so, I apply my bioinformatic knowledge daily into a variety of projects.

Don't hesitate to contact me for any requests or questions! 💬
And if you want to learn more about those projects or are interested in some form of collaboration, 
you can contact me by mail: guillaume.deflandre@uclouvain.be
